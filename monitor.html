        <p>Benefits:

Ultra-slim Design
Featuring an ultra-slim and sleek profile the Samsung SF350 monitor measures less than 0.4inch thick. Make a stylish statement while staying productive with the 22" screen. The simple circular stand will add a modern look to your space.

Eye Saver Mode
Eye Saver Mode optimizes your viewing comfort by reducing blue light emissions and flickers at the touch of a button. Read documents, play games, watch movies and edit photos for long periods of time, and experience a comfortable and pleasing view, without worrying about eye strain or fatigue.

Wide Viewing Angle
Wide Viewing Panel provides 178°wide viewing angle horizontally and vertically, so that you can experience the optimal screen from any position.

Eco-friendly Monitor
The Eco-Saving Plus feature reduces screen brightness to save power, plus the screen brightness automatically transitions fluidly—reducing energy use even more. The monitor itself is also constructed without PVC*
